          Introduction
        </Typography>

        <Typography>
          The web development landscape has evolved dramatically over the past
          few years. With the rise of component-based architectures, server-side
          rendering, and edge computing, developers now have more powerful tools
          than ever before to create fast, scalable, and user-friendly
          applications.
        </Typography>

        <Typography>
          In this article, we&apos;ll explore the key trends and technologies
          that are defining the future of web development, from React Server
          Components to the edge-first deployment strategies that are becoming
          the new standard.

          The Rise of Server Components
        </Typography>

        <Typography>
          React Server Components represent a paradigm shift in how we think
          about rendering. By moving computation to the server, we can reduce
          bundle sizes, improve performance, and create more secure
          applications. This approach allows developers to write components that
          run on the server while maintaining the interactive capabilities of
          client-side React.
        </Typography>

        <Typography variant="blockquote">
          Server Components are not just a new feature—they&apos;re a new way of
          thinking about the boundaries between client and server.
        </Typography>

        <Typography variant="h3" className="mt-4">
          Key Benefits
        </Typography>

        <Typography>The advantages of server components include:</Typography>

        <Typography variant="ul">
          <li>Reduced JavaScript bundle size</li>
          <li>Better SEO and initial page load performance</li>
          <li>Enhanced security through server-side data fetching</li>
          <li>Simplified state management for data-heavy applications</li>
        </Typography>

        <Typography variant="h2" className="mt-6">
          Edge Computing and Deployment
        </Typography>

        <Typography>
          Edge computing has moved from a niche optimization to a fundamental
          requirement for modern web applications. By deploying code closer to
          users, we can achieve sub-100ms response times globally, creating
          experiences that feel instant regardless of geographic location.
        </Typography>

        <Typography>
          Platforms like Vercel Edge Functions, Cloudflare Workers, and AWS
          Lambda@Edge have made it easier than ever to deploy and scale
          applications at the edge, opening new possibilities for real-time
          applications and personalized user experiences.
        </Typography>

          Looking Ahead
        </Typography>

        <Typography>
          As we look to the future, several trends are emerging that will
          continue to shape web development. The convergence of AI and web
          development, the maturation of WebAssembly, and the ongoing evolution
          of web standards all point to an exciting future for the web platform.
        </Typography>

        <Typography>
          The key to success in this rapidly evolving landscape is to stay
          curious, experiment with new technologies, and always keep the user
          experience at the center of our decisions. The tools will continue to
          change, but the fundamental goal of creating fast, accessible, and
          delightful web experiences remains constant.
