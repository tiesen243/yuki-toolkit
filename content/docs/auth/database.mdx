## Relationships

The database schema establishes the following relationships between tables:

- **User to Account**: One-to-many relationship. A user can have multiple accounts across different providers.
- **User to Session**: One-to-many relationship. A user can have multiple active sessions.
- **Account to User**: Many-to-one relationship. Each account belongs to exactly one user.
- **Session to User**: Many-to-one relationship. Each session belongs to exactly one user.
