Auth is a flexible, lightweight authentication library inspired by [Lucia Auth](https://lucia-auth.com/), designed for developers who want to build secure, custom authentication systems from the ground up.

## Overview

Auth provides the core building blocks for authentication without dictating your database schema, user flows, or framework choices. It gives you:

- **Framework Agnostic**: Works with any JavaScript framework
- **Database Agnostic**: Adapters for popular databases with a simple interface to write your own
- **Typed**: First-class TypeScript support
- **Session Management**: Secure, stateful sessions
- **OAuth**: Simple integration with OAuth providers
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Lightweight core with modular extensions

## Key Concepts

### Authentication vs. Authorization

- **Authentication**: Verifying who the user is (Auth's primary focus)
- **Authorization**: Determining what the user can do (built on top of Auth)

### Sessions

Auth uses secure, stateful sessions stored in your database:

- Session tokens are sent as HTTP-only cookies
- Each session is linked to a specific user
- Sessions can be invalidated individually or globally for a user
